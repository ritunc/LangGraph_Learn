Subject: Notification of Leave due to Illness
Dear Manager,
I am writing to inform you that, unfortunately, I will be taking a leave of absence tomorrow due to health reasons. I am currently unwell and need to take the day to recover.
I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am able to return.
Thank you for your understanding.
Best,
Ritun
